    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a very simple and traditional spaghetti recipe that has a completion time of 15 minutes</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef OR ground beef and ground pork mix OR mild Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 large yellow or sweet onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>8 ounces cremini/baby bella mushrooms, sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>3-4 large cloves of garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry red wine</li>
        <li>2 (24 ounce) jars of red pasta sauce OR 5-6 cups of homemade pasta sauce</li>
        <li>½ teaspoons oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>3 cups low-sodium chicken stock</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Spaghetti:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces regular or thick spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh grated parmesan</li>
        <li>1 (0.5 ounce) container fresh basil, cut into chiffonade</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large dutch oven over medium-high heat, cook ground beef and pork along with the onion, mushrooms and garlic until cooked through, draining some excess fat off if necessary. Deglaze the dutch oven with the red wine. </li>
        <li>Add the pasta sauce, oregano, red pepper flakes, salt/pepper, sugar and chicken stock. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer for about 10 minutes, adjusting seasoning if needed.</li>
        <li>Bring to a gentle boil. Break spaghetti noodles in half and add to the sauce. Stir to combine and reduce heat to a simmer; cover and cook for 12-15 minutes, stirring often to prevent pasta from sticking together in clumps.</li>
        <li>After 12-15 minutes, check spaghetti for doneness; an additional minute or two may be needed. Once noodles are al dente, turn heat off and stir in grated parmesan and chiffonade basil. Garnish with finely chopped parsley and additional parmesan if you like. </li>
    </ol>
